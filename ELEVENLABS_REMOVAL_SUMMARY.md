- Optimized re-rendering

## Verification

The removal has been completed while preserving all other functionality:
- Chatbot continues to communicate with Chatbase API
- Message formatting and styling remain intact
- Copy functionality for messages is preserved
- Mobile responsiveness is maintained
- All other UI/UX improvements are kept

## Testing

To verify the removal was successful:
1. Run `npm install` to update dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
3. Navigate to the chatbot page
4. Verify:
   - No console errors related to crypto or ElevenLabs
   - Chatbot functions normally with Chatbase API
   - Copy functionality works for messages
   - Responsive design works on all screen sizes
   - No Speak/Stop buttons are visible

## Deployment

The website should now deploy successfully to Netlify without:
- Rollup dependency errors
- Crypto module resolution issues
- Browser compatibility problems
- Memory-related build failures

## Next Steps

The chatbot now functions without ElevenLabs integration while maintaining all other enhancements:
- Improved visual branding with official PANASA logo
- Enhanced user experience with better message formatting
- Mobile-responsive design for all device sizes
- Copy functionality for easy content sharing
- Proper error handling and performance optimizations

If text-to-speech functionality is needed in the future, alternative browser-compatible solutions should be considered.
