## Technical Implementation

### Service Layer

- **Model**: eleven_multilingual_v2
- **Output Format**: mp3_44100_128

### Caching Strategy
- Audio responses are cached to reduce API usage
- Cache is limited to 50 entries to manage memory usage
- Cache keys are generated based on voice ID and text content

## Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for API failures
- Graceful degradation when text-to-speech is unavailable
- User-friendly error messages in the console

## Mobile Responsiveness
- Speak buttons optimized for touch interfaces
- Visual feedback adapted for mobile screen sizes

## Testing
To test the integration:
1. Ensure you have a valid ElevenLabs API key in your `.env` file
2. Navigate to the chatbot page
3. Interact with the bot to generate responses
4. Click the "Speak" button on any assistant message
5. Verify audio playback and controls work as expected

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:
1. **No Audio Playback**: Check API key validity and browser audio permissions
2. **Slow Response Times**: First requests may be slower due to cold start
3. **Voice Quality Issues**: Verify model and output format settings

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for future development:
1. Voice selection interface for users
2. Volume control for audio playback
3. Playback speed adjustment
4. Multi-language voice support
5. Custom voice training integration
