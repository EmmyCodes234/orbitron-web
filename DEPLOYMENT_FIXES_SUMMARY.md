# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to resolve deployment issues encountered during the Netlify build process.

## Issues Encountered

### Rollup Dependency Error
```
Error: Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu. npm has a bug related to optional dependencies (https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4828). Please try `npm i` again after removing both package-lock.json and node_modules directory.
```

This is a known issue with npm and optional dependencies, particularly when building on different architectures (local Windows development vs. Linux build environment).

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Netlify Configuration (.npmrc)
Created a `.npmrc` file with the following settings:
```
engine-strict=false
legacy-peer-deps=true
```

These settings help resolve dependency conflicts and prevent strict engine requirements from causing build failures.

### 2. Netlify Build Environment Configuration (netlify.toml)
Created a `netlify.toml` file with optimized build settings:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"

[build.environment]
  NODE_OPTIONS = "--max_old_space_size=4096"
  NPM_FLAGS = "--prefer-offline"
```

The environment variables help with:
- Increasing Node.js memory allocation for large builds
- Using npm's offline mode to avoid network issues during dependency installation

### 3. Dependency Cleanup
Removed the problematic package-lock.json file and regenerated it to ensure compatibility with the build environment.

### 4. Package Version Verification
Verified that all package versions are correct:
- `@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js`: Updated from v1.0.0 to v2.18.0

## Additional Recommendations

### For Future Deployments
1. Consider using `npm ci` instead of `npm install` for more consistent builds
2. Pin Node.js version in Netlify settings to match local development environment
3. Use a .nvmrc file to specify the exact Node.js version

### For Development Workflow
1. Regularly update dependencies to prevent version conflicts
2. Test builds in a clean environment periodically
3. Monitor for breaking changes in major dependency updates

## Testing
After implementing these fixes:
1. Local builds succeed with `npm run build`
2. Development server runs correctly with `npm run dev`
3. All functionality remains intact including:
   - ElevenLabs text-to-speech integration
   - Chatbase API communication
   - Responsive design
   - Copy functionality
   - Multi-language support

## Conclusion
These changes should resolve the deployment issues by:
1. Addressing the npm optional dependency bug
2. Providing consistent build environment configuration
3. Ensuring dependency compatibility across different architectures
4. Optimizing build performance and memory usage

The fixes maintain all existing functionality while improving deployment reliability.
