# PANASA Accessibility Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines the accessibility standards and best practices for the PANASA website. Our goal is to ensure the website is usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.

## WCAG Compliance
The PANASA website aims to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, which include:
- **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
- **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable
- **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies

## Color and Contrast

### Contrast Ratios
- **Text and Images of Text**: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio (AA standard)
- **Large Text** (18pt or 14pt bold): Minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
- **UI Components and Graphical Objects**: Minimum 3:1 contrast ratio

### Color Usage
- All interactive elements have sufficient color contrast
- Color is never the only means of conveying information
- Focus indicators are clearly visible against all backgrounds

## Keyboard Navigation

### Focus Management
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Logical tab order follows visual hierarchy
- Visible focus indicators for all focusable elements
- Focus is managed appropriately during dynamic content changes

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Standard keyboard shortcuts are supported:
  - Tab: Move between interactive elements
  - Enter: Activate buttons and links
  - Space: Activate checkboxes and buttons
  - Arrow keys: Navigate within component groups (e.g., radio buttons, menus)

### Skip Links
- "Skip to main content" link is available at the beginning of each page
- Hidden until focused, then clearly visible
- Bypasses repetitive navigation links

## Screen Reader Support

### Semantic HTML
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
- Landmark elements (header, nav, main, footer)
- Lists properly marked up (ul, ol, dl)
- Tables with appropriate headers and structure

### ARIA Implementation
- ARIA roles and attributes used appropriately
- Dynamic content updates announced to screen readers
- Form fields with proper labels and error messaging
- Custom components with appropriate ARIA patterns

### Labels and Instructions
- All form controls have associated labels
- Descriptive link text that makes sense out of context
- Instructions provided for complex interactions
- Error messages clearly associated with form fields

## Images and Media

### Alternative Text
- Informative images have descriptive alt text
- Decorative images have empty alt attributes (alt="")
- Complex images have detailed descriptions
- Charts and graphs have table alternatives

### Multimedia Content
- Videos include captions and transcripts
- Audio content includes transcripts
- Media players are keyboard accessible
- Auto-playing media can be paused or stopped

## Forms and Inputs

### Labeling
- All form fields have visible labels
- Labels are programmatically associated with inputs
- Placeholder text is not used as a substitute for labels
- Field instructions are clear and concise

### Validation
- Form validation occurs on submit
- Error messages are descriptive and actionable
- Errors are clearly associated with form fields
- Success messages confirm successful submission

### Input Assistance
- Autocomplete attributes for common form fields
- Appropriate input types (email, tel, date, etc.)
- Sufficient touch target sizes (minimum 44px)
- Clear error recovery processes

## Responsive Design and Mobile

### Touch Targets
- Interactive elements are at least 44px in size
- Adequate spacing between touch targets
- Gestures are simple and standard
- Custom gestures have alternative methods

### Screen Reader Optimization
- Content reflows appropriately on smaller screens
- Zoom support up to 200% without loss of functionality
- Orientation changes do not lock content
- Text remains readable at all zoom levels

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Testing
- Regular automated accessibility testing integrated into development workflow
- Tools used include axe-core, Lighthouse, and WAVE
- Issues identified and resolved before deployment

### Manual Testing
- Regular manual testing with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Keyboard-only navigation testing
- Color contrast verification
- User testing with people with disabilities

### Browser and Device Support
- Tested across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Tested on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Screen reader compatibility verified
- Keyboard navigation tested on all platforms

## Common Components and Patterns

### Navigation
- Consistent navigation across all pages
- Breadcrumb navigation for complex sites
- Multiple ways to find content (search, sitemap, navigation)
- Current page clearly indicated in navigation

### Buttons and Links
- Clear visual distinction between buttons and links
- Buttons used for actions, links for navigation
- External links clearly identified
- Download links indicate file type and size

### Tables
- Simple tables for data presentation
- Proper header cells with scope attributes
- Responsive table patterns for small screens
- Sortable tables with clear indication of sort state

### Accordions and Tabs
- Keyboard accessible
- Clear indication of expanded/collapsed state
- Focus management during content changes
- ARIA attributes for screen reader support

## Content Guidelines

### Readability
- Plain language used throughout
- Sentence length kept to 25 words or less
- Paragraph length limited to 5 sentences or less
- Lists used to break up complex information

### Headings
- Clear heading hierarchy maintained
- No skipped heading levels
- Descriptive headings that summarize content
- Unique page titles for each page

### Links
- Descriptive link text that makes sense out of context
- Links clearly distinguishable from surrounding text
- External links clearly identified
- Links to downloads indicate file type

## Continuous Improvement

### Training
- Regular accessibility training for development team
- Content creators educated on accessible content practices
- Designers trained on accessible design principles
- Regular updates on new accessibility standards

### Monitoring
- Regular accessibility audits
- User feedback mechanisms
- Analytics tracking for accessibility issues
- Continuous integration of accessibility improvements

### Feedback
- Clear process for reporting accessibility issues
- Prompt response to accessibility concerns
- Regular review of accessibility feedback
- Inclusion of users with disabilities in testing
