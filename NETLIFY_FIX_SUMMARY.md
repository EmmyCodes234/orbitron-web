# Netlify Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue
The Netlify deployment was failing with the error message "Failed to parse configuration" at line 9.

## Diagnosis
After reviewing the configuration, the issue was likely caused by one of the following:
1. A syntax error in the netlify.toml file
2. Conflicting redirect configurations between netlify.toml and the _redirects file
3. Hidden characters or encoding issues in the netlify.toml file

## Solution Applied
1. Removed the redirects section from netlify.toml since we already have a _redirects file in the public directory
2. Added the functions configuration to netlify.toml to properly configure Netlify Functions
3. Completely recreated the netlify.toml file to ensure there are no hidden characters or encoding issues

## Updated netlify.toml Configuration
```toml
[build]
command = "npm run build"
publish = "dist"
functions = "netlify/functions"
```

## Next Steps
1. Commit the updated netlify.toml file to your repository
2. Push the changes to trigger a new deployment
3. Monitor the build logs to ensure the deployment completes successfully

## Additional Notes
- The SPA routing is handled by the _redirects file in the public directory
- The netlify/functions directory contains a sample function that can be expanded as needed
- All future Netlify-specific configurations should be added to netlify.toml
